WHAT I LEARNED: I learned how to use sequential searches and how to apply them differently, such as dividing it up or going straight through.

WHAT I ENJOYED: I really enjoyed incorporating my music tastes and applying them with CS. I also like discovering the different ways to write the linear search code.
